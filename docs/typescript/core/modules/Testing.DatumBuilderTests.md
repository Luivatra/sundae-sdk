## DatumBuilder Tests

This file exports testing functions to run against your builder.
Most tests are automated but ensure that the [DatumBuilder](../classes/Core.DatumBuilder.md)
instance you pass in is run against real test data and outputs
valid CBOR hex strings to attach to your transactions!

For an example, see:

**`Package Description`**
